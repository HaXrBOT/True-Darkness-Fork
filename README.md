## **Description**

Moody brightness not dark enough? Do you want moonless nights and unlit caverns to be pitch black? This mod is for you!

In addition to maintaining the mod for newer versions, this fork also fixes compatibility issues with [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons) and adds some server-side functionality, such as config syncing.
