- Added option to use different moon phase darkening styles.
    - **Default**: The original style.
    - **Gradual**: Makes the darkening more linear than the original (Thank you **[minhty-fresh](https://github.com/minhty-fresh)** for the PR)
    - **Better Than Wolves**: Mimics the style of the BTW mod. (Thank you **[ivangeevo](https://github.com/ivangeevo)** for the PR)
